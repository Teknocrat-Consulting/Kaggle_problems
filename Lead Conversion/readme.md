# Lead Conversion Prediction Model

## Overview

In today's competitive business environment, it's crucial for organizations to efficiently convert leads into customers. This project presents a predictive model designed to forecast the likelihood of lead conversion based on historical data and various lead attributes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to assist businesses in prioritizing leads, optimizing marketing strategies, and ultimately improving conversion rates.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Preparation and Exploration

- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights are gained through visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the distribution and relationships among variables.

### 2. Feature Engineering

- **Creation of New Features**: Additional features are engineered from existing ones to capture more information and improve model performance.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables are transformed into numerical representations suitable for modeling.

### 3. Model Building

- **Logistic Regression**: The core predictive model utilizes logistic regression due to its interpretability and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
- **Training and Validation**: The dataset is split into training and validation sets for model training and evaluation, respectively.
- **Model Selection**: Various model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and AUC are utilized to select the best-performing model.

### 4. Model Evaluation

- **Performance Metrics**: The model's performance is assessed using a variety of metrics to gauge its accuracy and reliability.
- **Cross-Validation**: Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure the model's robustness and generalization capability.

### 5. Lead Scoring

- **Conversion Probability**: Each lead is assigned a conversion probability score based on the model's predictions.
- **Lead Prioritization**: Leads are ranked according to their conversion probability scores, enabling prioritization of high-potential leads.
